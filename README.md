Since the tkinter is a module that already comes with python as preinstalled. So you don't need to write "pip3 install tkinter".
The only external file you need to download is the font file but it depends on you because you can use the build in fonts like Arial and some more.
However I prefered to use a not build in font which is Ds-Digital, by this way it looks and feels like a digital watch but as I said it depends on you.
The font file is also given with the code file.
